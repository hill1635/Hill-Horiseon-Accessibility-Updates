# Hill-Horiseon-Accessibility-Updates
For this project, the html and css files for the Horiseon SEO Services site were cleaned up to make it easier to read and make modifications to in the future.  Semantic tags were substituted for div tags to give the page a clearer structure to the reader.  Classes were consolidated where applicable to broader elements in css when properties overlapped.  

While I initially took the classes out altogether for the sections, I decided to add them back in order to make customization easier in the future if they want more customization.  I also added a "row" div for the main and aside elements to contain them together in to add some symmetry to the two elements if either changes in size and a "container" div to wrap the whole website up together.  The list in the nav bar was initially removed as it seemed unnecessary but was also added back later on as I had read that is standard practice.

It was a good time and everyone's similin'.
